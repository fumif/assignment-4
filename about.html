					<h1>about</h1>
						<div id="about_left">
							<p>Frank Kozik was born in Madrid, Spain in 1962. At the age of 14, he moved to the United States and settled in Austin Texas.</p>

							<p>Credited with single handedly reviving the "lost" art of the concert poster, Frank's creative career grew largely out of his enthusiasm for Austin's growing underground rock scene in the mid-eighties. Starting with black and white flyers for friends bands posted on telephone polls, his reputation grew as an artist who's work was graphically compelling as well as culturally gripping. With hundreds of full-color, limited edition, silk screened posters under his belt for such renowned artists as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Beastie Boys, he has also been the subject of many magazine articles such as Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Spin, and Details. </p>

							<p>Not limited to the rock world, Frank has also done work for Nike, BASF, Slim Jim and MTV. His newest venture, fkozik.com, is an interactive site dedicated to creating a place for fans to go as well as purchase his art, both of which are firmly dedicated to producing the ultimate in collectible show posters and prints.</p>
